## Mentorbuddies

Mentorbuddies enables self-learners to seek human-level career advice and guidance from working professionals who are where they aspire to be.
There is an explosion of online resources for self-learning however people still need to be encouraged and guided by real people in order to push through thoughts of aloneness, uncertainty, and feeling's of being lost.

Education and learning is very much about emotional strength and cultivation as it is about raw information exchange.
